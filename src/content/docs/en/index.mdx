## Welcome to the LarvixON documentation

**Wrocław University of Science and Technology**  
**Faculty of Computer Science and Telecommunications**  
Program: IST  
**Team project**

LarvixON is an innovative diagnostic solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect xenobiotics in patient plasma by analyzing movement patterns of Galleria mellonella larvae.

<Aside type="tip">
  The project aims to achieve high sensitivity and specificity of the classifier
  with an analysis time not exceeding 20 minutes.

## About the project

LarvixON develops a rapid diagnostic system based on AI that analyzes larval movement patterns to identify characteristic organism responses to toxic substances. The system combines:

- Scientific research – movement data analysis and behavioral feature extraction
- Software engineering – diagnostic application with a complete pipeline
- Machine learning – classification models for xenobiotic detection
- Medical use cases – diagnostic support in near real time
