---

The goal of the project is to develop a rapid diagnostic system based on artificial intelligence for detecting toxic substances in patient plasma.

The key method involves analyzing the movement patterns of _Galleria mellonella_ larvae that have been administered plasma samples. The system uses machine learning algorithms to identify characteristic, subtle motor reactions of larvae to toxic substances.

The ultimate goal is to implement a novel method that detects toxic compounds, contributing to improved treatment efficacy and reduced medical intervention time in life-threatening situations.
