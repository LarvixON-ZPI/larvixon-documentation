Below is a complete scenario of a diagnostic task performed by a logged-in user. The process includes authorization, commissioning a video analysis, monitoring its status, and interpreting the results.

## Step 1: Authorization

The process begins on the welcome screen. If the user has used the application before, the system automatically verifies the validity of the locally stored access token. For new sessions, login is required.

## Step 2: New Analysis Commissioning

The user initiates the research process by launching a multi-step wizard.

1.  **Video Upload**: Uploading the file with larvae recording.
2.  **Clinical Description**: Optional notes.
3.  **Patient Selection**: Searching for a patient by PESEL number.

## Step 3: Progress Monitoring

After submitting the form, the new order appears on the analysis list (Grid). The user sees the processing status (e.g., _Pending_, _Processing_, _Completed_).

## Step 4: Results and Reporting

Once the ML model completes the analysis, the user gains access to the details.

### Metadata and Preview

The view contains a video thumbnail, patient data, and examination status.

### Detection Results

The key element is the panel showing detected toxic substances along with the percentage confidence indicator of the model's prediction.
